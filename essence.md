# Essence - Way-of-Working

The state Principles Established was reached after the group's first meeting as
we all had an overview of the task, and the context, constraints and tools
needed to accomplish it. At our first meeting we also decided on a specific
open source project to base our work on, and this made it even clearer to us
what tools were necessary for our task.

As we completed the onboarding process and became more familiar with the
project, and the specifics of what needed to be done, we reached the Foundation
Established state. We started interacting with the code base and tools, first
by running code analysis tools and working with Issues in our forked GitHub
repository, and reached the In Use state. We maintained regular meetings and
communication, which also allowed us to handle feedback on our way of working.

The team is currently in the In Place state, as every team member is using our
tools and contributing to our work. The Working Well state will be reached when
the team becomes even more used to our tools and practices, and our
Way-of-Working stabilizes further, and it starts to feel natural.

One improvement that has happened during the course is familiarization with
collaborative development practices (GitHub functionality, communicating with
the team). When individuals in a group are more experienced with this, forming
a new group becomes quicker. More improvement is also still possible in this
area.
